MsysgitWrapper is a set of MSBuild tasks to work with Git repositories.

It is (as the name suggests) a thin wrapper around msysgit (http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/). 
This means that msysgit *must* be installed on your build computer. If not, these tasks will fail.

Currently the following tasks are declared:

- Clone
  Clone a Git repository
- Checkout
  Switch to a specific branch or SHA in a local Git repository.
- Head
  Returns the latest SHA from the current branch in a local Git repository. 

See for examples the 'examples' directory. Tested against msysgit version 1.7.6.

MsysgitWrapper is released under a GPL3 license.

Happy coding!
