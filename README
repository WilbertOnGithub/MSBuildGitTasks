MSBuildGitTasks is a set of MSBuild tasks to work with Git repositories.

Currently the following task is available:

- Clone
  Clone a Git repository. After cloning it is possible to switch to a specific branch or SHA.
  The Clone tasks also returns the latest SHA. Useful to include in for example a readme or
  to inject it into your assemblyinfo files.

See for MSBuild example projects the 'examples' directory. 

MSBuildGitTasks is released under a GPL3 license.

Happy coding!
